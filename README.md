In this project railway gates get closed automatically on the arrival of the train and open when the train departs . The main purpose of the project is to avoid accidents and save time. We have added a timer which shows the duration for which the gate will remain close. We have even implemented obstacle detection in order to minimize the suicide rate.The prototype was implemented using AVR ATmega8 microcontroller.
